Finally, as an optional step, actuators are used to bring about physical change back into the tangible world. In this lab, we will use a capacitive touchpad to sense a touch, process the outputted electrical signal using a combination of additional circuit elements, and then actuate an indicator, an LED, to indicate that a touch has been detected.

The resistor only adds a discharge path for the shared charge, making current leak *out* of the capacitors, making the circuit worse, is what some of you might be able to figure out on paper. While this is true, the $100k\\Omega$ resistor also helps to stabilize the $V_{+}$ node. If the resistor is not there, the $V_{+}$ node is left completely floating, as the input resistance of the Op Amp is infinite, and the node is completely disconnected from any power or ground. Floating nodes traditionally are not very stable (as the name might also imply) and are very susceptible  to background electrical interference. By draining the shared charge slowly, this creates a reference to ground, making the node stable, increasing the repeatability and robustness of the circuit."
